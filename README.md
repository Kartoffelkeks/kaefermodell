# KÃ¤fer Model

NetLogo model for studying and analyzing ground beetles around kettle holes.

In order to process real data, you need three folders: code, data and figures.

Put your data in the data folder and start with 1A or create data with the model and start with 1B:

* [1A_read_real_data.R](code/1A_read_real_data.R)
* [1B_read_behaviour_output.R](code/1B_read_behaviour_output.R)
* [2_estimate_parameters_MCMC_real.R](code/2_estimate_parameters_MCMC_real.R)
* [3_visualize_mcmc.R](code/3_visualize_mcmc.R)
* [kaeferModel.nlogo](code/kaeferModel.nlogo)
* [utils.R](code/utils.R)
* [kaeferModel.Rproj](code/kaeferModel.Rproj)

Some code has to be adapted to your system, notation or data. These are marked with `####### adapt to your needs`
